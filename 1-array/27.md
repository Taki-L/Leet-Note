Given an array nums and a value val, remove all instances of that value in-place and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

The order of elements can be changed. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.
```
Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
Output: 2, nums = [2,2]
Explanation:
Your function should return length = 2,
with the first two elements of nums being 2.
It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
For example if you return 2 with nums = [2,2,3,3] or nums = [2,2,0,0],
your answer will be accepted.
```
```
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,4,0,3]
Explanation:
Your function should return length = 5,
with the first five elements of nums containing 0, 1, 3, 0, and 4.
Note that the order of those five elements can be arbitrary.
It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.

# Solution1-Violent

Two "for" loops, the outside is for traverse the whole array, and the inside one is used when found nums[i]==val, moving the entire array forward one place.

```
class Solution {
public:
    int removeElement(vector<int>& nums, int val) {
        int len = nums.size();
        for(int i = 0; i< len ;i++){
            if(nums[i]==val){
                for(int j = i; j<len-1;j++){
                    nums[j] = nums[j+1];
                }
                i--;
                len--;
            }
        }
        return len;
    }
};
```
## Note:
①：
"i--" is needed especially when there is two vals next to each other, such as "nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2", if there is not an "i--", the loop will jump the val behind.

②：There is no need to declare one element just for count, we can just decrease the variable that records the length of the array one by one.

# Solution2-Double Pointer Method
## --also known as Fast and Slow Pointer Method

```
class Solution {
public:
    int removeElement(vector<int>& nums, int val) {
        int j = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i <nums.size(); i++){
            if(nums[i]!=val){
                nums[j++] = nums[i];
            }
        }
        return j;
    }
};
```
## Note2:
Here is a little tip, "nums[j++] = nums[i];" includes two step, "j++" and assignment, by the way the "j++" inside is permanent, not just effective in this sentence, this is a little trick to make the code concise.
