# [206. Reverse Linked List](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/)

Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.


**Example 1:**

![image/206-1.jpg](image/206-1.jpg)
```c++
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]
```
**Example 2:**

![image/206-2.jpg](image/206-2.jpg)
```c++
Input: head = [1,2]
Output: [2,1]
```
**Example 3:**
```c++
Input: head = []
Output: []
```

**Constraints:**

The number of nodes in the list is the range [0, 5000].

-5000 <= Node.val <= 5000
 

**Follow up:**

A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?
